===========================================================================
The 2nd International Workshop on Ethics in Computer Security (EthiCS 2023)
===========================================================================

Co-located with `The Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS'23). <https://https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2023/>`__ February 27, 2023.



Ethics in computer security research are increasingly
critical. Security research may not only involve human subjects and user
data, thus is subject to ethics considerations, but also assess the
security of computer systems by
breaking them (a.k.a offensive security research), which often 
raises ethical concerns. Unethical security research would cause
significant harms to the society and in turn hurt the community.
“Ethics in Computer Security Research” is still an
under-studied area. Researchers may lack clear guidelines and
resources. 
For instance, many research institutions still do not have IRB or the
ethics-review board, and researchers are expected to properly handle
ethical concerns on their own.
Consequently, ethical concerns are not uncommon in security research.
It is thus urgent for the community to provide ethical guidelines for
international researchers and enforce ethics as a discipline.
This workshop aims to provide an international forum for researchers,
practitioners, and administrators, from security and other areas, to
bring and exchange perspectives, lessons learned, and new insights
into the guidelines and practices of ethical computer security
research. As a result, it expects to help generate new guidelines for
future ethical security research, to call for resources assisting
security researchers, and to raise awareness of even implicit ethical
concerns.


Scope and topics
================

EthiCS welcomes submissions on studies, proposals of protocols, reflections, risk modeling, measurements on ethics in security research, as well as technical papers on protecting data and providing controlled safe experimental environments. Full papers, work-in-progress short reports, and proposals are all welcome. We would like to broadly invite submissions related to ethics in security research. The covered topics include, but not limited to:

- Ethical reflections and analyses on existing security research
- Ethical considerations in security research

  + How ethical concerns are properly addressed in existing research
  + Implicit ethical concerns identified in security research

- Proposals of ethics protocols
  
  + How ethical concerns can be addressed at institutions without IRB or ethics review boards
  + Ethical considerations beyond IRB

- Modeling of threats and risks of security research
- Subject-consent management
- Techniques for ethical research
  
  + Approaches for protecting sensitive data
  + Approaches for controlled and safe experimental environments

- Measurements and user study
  
  + Risks, impact, fairness, etc.


All papers will be published by the Internet Society.


Submissions
===========
EthiCS encourages submissions of full papers and short papers from
academia, industry, and government. Short papers must be up to 4
pages and long papers must be up to 8 pages, including references.
All papers are in the NDSS conference proceedings format. Submitted
papers must adhere to `the NDSS symposium proceeding template <https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2023/templates>`__. 
Submissions must be written in English and typeset in A4 format.
We recommend using LaTeX, and suggest you first compile the supplied
LaTeX source as is, checking that you obtain the same PDF as the one
supplied. Then, write your paper into the LaTeX template, replacing
the boilerplate text. Please do not use other templates.  
Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors
should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures
that might create problems for reviewers. Your document should render
correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white.



EthiCS will
accept anonymous submissions and apply a double-blind peer-review process for
them. Submissions must be fully anonymized, including submissions
discussing existing research or author’s prior research. All
submissions are expected to follow the guidelines for ethical
research and human subject research if applicable and address
potential ethical concerns. 

The PC will select best paper award(s) for work that provides significant insights, ideas, or approaches for ethical security research.

Papers must be submitted at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ethics2023 and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline expires.


Important dates
===============
.. role:: strike
   :class: strike

- December 20, 2022 (AoE, UTC -12): Paper submission

All papers will be published by the Internet Society.
At least one authors of each accepted
submission will register and present at the workshop.
Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication
clearances.

conference to present their paper, but will make allowances for
remote presentation in cases where all authors of a paper have
legitimate reasons they are unable to attend in person.
