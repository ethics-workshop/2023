<p><strong>Title</strong></p>
<p>Reconciling the Hacker Spirit with Ethical Cybersecurity Education</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Hackers are the dragons of the digital world. We are shrouded in mystery, steeped in intrigue, and imbued with a sort of romance.  But unlike the dragons of times long gone, hackers are real, and it is critical to the continued security of our society to create more ethical hackers in a scalable way. But an ethical hacker is still a hacker, and in order for them to effectively operate in the open seas of cyberspace, whether in the academic, industry, or government world, we must teach students to understand and adopt the hacker mindset while maintaining their ethical integrity and instincts.</p>
<p>This talk will convey my thoughts on the teaching of ethical hackers, derived from my experiences teaching cybersecurity at various stages of student academic careers and in leading cybersecurity competitions and real-world vulnerability research efforts. I don't claim to have the answers, but I hope that the thoughts shared here will make good starting points for deeper discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>Yan Shoshitaishvili is an Assistant Professor at Arizona State University, where he pursues parallel passions of cybersecurity research, real-world impact, and education. His research focuses on automated program analysis and vulnerability detection techniques. Aside from publishing dozens of research papers in top academic venues, Yan led Shellphish’s participation in the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge, achieving the creation of a fully autonomous hacking system that won third place in the competition.</p>
<p>Underpinning much of his research is angr, the open-source program analysis framework created by Yan and his collaborators. This framework has powered hundreds of research papers, helped find thousands of security bugs, and continues to be used in research labs and companies around the world.</p>
<p>When he is not doing research, Yan participates in the enthusiast and educational cybersecurity communities. He is a Captain Emeritus of Shellphish, one of the oldest ethical hacking groups in the world, and a founder of the Order of the Overflow, with whom he ran DEF CON CTF, the “world championship” of cybersecurity competitions, from 2018 through 2021. Now, he helps demystify the hacking scene as a co-host of the CTF RadiOOO podcast and forge connections between the government and the hacking community through his participation on CISA’s Technical Advisory Council. In order to inspire students to pursue cybersecurity (and, ultimately, compete at DEF CON!), Yan created pwn.college, an open practice-makes-perfect learning platform that is revolutionizing cybersecurity education for aspiring hackers around the world.</p>
